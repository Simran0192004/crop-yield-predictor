# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Polynomial Regression

## 📌 Overview

This project leverages **Polynomial Regression** to predict **crop yield** based on key environmental factors like **rainfall**, **temperature**, and **pesticide usage**. By capturing non-linear relationships in agricultural data, this model aims to support data-driven farming practices and optimize crop productivity.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is composed of multiple Excel sheets representing:
- **Rainfall**
- **Temperature**
- **Pesticide Usage**
- **Crop Yield**

These sheets were combined and cleaned to form a unified dataset for model training.

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Polynomial Linear Regression**  
  Captures non-linear trends between environmental features and crop yield, making it more flexible than simple linear models.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA and Visualization)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and preprocess raw agricultural data  
- Combine multiple sources into a single training set  
- Train and evaluate Polynomial Regression models  
- Visualize predictions vs actual yield values

---

## 📈 Results

The model demonstrated strong performance in capturing complex patterns between weather conditions and crop yield. Evaluation metrics like R² and RMSE were used to assess accuracy.
